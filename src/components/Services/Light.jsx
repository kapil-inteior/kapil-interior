              Lighting plays an integral part in interior design, offering both
              functionality and aesthetic enhancement. We provide a range of
              lighting solutions to suit your style and specific needs. From
              overhead ceiling lights and wall-mounted sconces to stylish table
              lamps, our lighting options are designed to enhance the mood of
              your space. Light, a form of electromagnetic radiation visible to
              the human eye, varies in characteristics such as direction, color,
              and brightness, and is essential for illuminating environments and
              elevating their visual charm. The right lighting does more than
              just improve visibilityâ€”it creates a warm, inviting atmosphere.
              Various lighting types, including task, accent, and ambient
              lighting, serve specific roles in transforming any room.
